But, did you know that New York City was the birthplace of pizza in America? Using skills learned from his hometown Naples, Italy, the first pizza in the US was crafted in the heart of Little Italy by Italian baker, Gennaro Lombardi. Fun Fact: Lombardiâ€™s Pizza was established in 1905 and is still around today!"
